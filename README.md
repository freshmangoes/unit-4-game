# unit-4-game
Crystal Collector game.

The randomized target score is initially hidden from the user, and the randomized values of each gem is hidden from the user. Once a gem is clicked, the target score is revealed and the user has to extrapolate the values of each gem from what is added to the current score. The goal is to achieve a score exactly that of the target score.
